# rewarding_project
A repository where you can contribute your code or a readme file. BUT: systemic contribution is needed. 

This will be happening each month.

Points to remember while making a pull request :
- make your files systematic: if you have images or any media files or several files, then put them together in a folder and then make pr.
- to make a pr, first fork it.
- the person with the maximum PRs merged in this repo, per month will get a special mention and may also win a chance to earn schwags.

Languages allowed in this repo:
- any programming language like Python , C++, etc.
- make sure the files pushed through PR have the correct extension in their filename, according to the langauge you have used.
- any markup language or associated files
- readme files
- no media files alone are not allowed.

## Note: You will become eligible for consideration of schwags if and only if your PRs get merged.Don't constantly message admins or maintainers regarding merging of your PRs. Your PRs if eligible will be merged.
