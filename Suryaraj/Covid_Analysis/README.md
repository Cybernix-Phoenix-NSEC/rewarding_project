# Covid Analysis
The world is perplexed by the outbreak of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome. The new coronavirus(COVID-19), reported in December 2019, had its epicentre in Wuhan,
Hubei province, in The People's Republic Of China and has spread to several countries.
It was declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation.
           
          We got this dataset from a website with the URL as https://worldometers.info/coronavirus.
          
          Now, this dataset consists of the statistical data of 188 countries of the world regarding
          the number of confirmed cases, the deaths and the recoveries and other related information.

          In this project we are going to analyse the same dataset using Python Pandas on windows machine
          but the project can be run on any machine support Python and Pandas. Besides pandas we also used 
          matplotlib python module for visualization of this dataset. 

          The whole project is divided into four major parts ie reading, analysis, visualization and export.
          All these part are further divided into menus for easy navigation.

          NOTE: Python is case-SENSITIVE so type exact Column Name wherever required.
